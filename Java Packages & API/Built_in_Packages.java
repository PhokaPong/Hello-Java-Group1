// The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment

// To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the 'import' keyword

/*
Syntax :

import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
